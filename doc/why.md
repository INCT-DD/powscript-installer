Powscript is just a bash dialect which transpiles to bash.
It can turn huge codebases into a smaller readable one.

* Less noise, Less picky, more readable
* Make it easy to write bash applications without too much hassle
* Some people prefer memorizing a minilanguage over bash code snippets/manuals/wikis
* the shell language evolves slowly, which makes it suitable for transpiling.

# Is something wrong with plain shellscript?

Absolutely not.
Powscript is not a replacement, it's a tool to promote shellscript.
